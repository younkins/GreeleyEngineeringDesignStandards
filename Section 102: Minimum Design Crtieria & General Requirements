# Section 102: Minimum Design Criteria & General Requirements

## A. Minimum Standards

1. The provisions stipulated in this section are general in nature and shall be considered as applicable to all parts of these Specifications, including any supplements and revisions. All construction within the public right-of-way shall be designed by or under the direct supervision of a Professional Engineer (PE) registered in the State of Colorado. All drawings and support data submitted to the City for approval shall bear their seal and signature. The City will issue no construction permits until a PE has certified these documents. A PE must certify any overlot grading completed during the design phase of the project prior to issuance of any construction permits.

2. The design criteria as presented are intended to aid in the preparation of plans and specifications for the City, including minimum standards where required. These design criteria are considered minimum, and a complete design will usually require more than are presented in this document. As with any design criteria, occasions may arise where the minimum standards are inappropriate. In these cases, a variance shall be considered. Written request for each variance should be directed to the City Public Works Director or designee.

3. Whenever the provisions of these Standards are found to be inconsistent with any other regulations or codes, the Engineer shall determine the most restrictive standard to apply. The provisions of these regulations are minimum requirements that do not preclude imposition of more restrictive standards by agreement or by law.

4. Projects shall comply with all laws, regulations, codes, and ordinances applicable to the design and the furnishing and performance of the work. Except where otherwise expressly required by applicable laws, regulations, codes, or ordinances, the City shall not be responsible for monitoring compliance with any law, regulation, code, or ordinance.

5. The City has subdivision regulations and development code to help define the various processes required for projects.

6. Before the Contractor begins work, an approved set of plans and specifications shall be on file with the City. The Contractor shall fully execute all contracts, bonds, insurance, permits, and licenses before beginning work.

7. City’s review and approval will be to determine only if the plans, specifications, and construction conform to the City’s requirements. City’s review and approval will not relieve the Design Professional and Contractor/Owner from responsibility for any variation from the City requirements or adequate design standards. The City’s review and approval shall not constitute any assumption of responsibility or liability for the design or construction.

8. It is the intent and purpose of these Standards and Specifications to obtain high-quality construction throughout, with the completed work complying with these Standards and Specifications.

9. Reference to standard specifications, manuals, or codes of any technical society, organization, or association or to the laws or regulations of any governmental authority, whether such reference is specific or by implication, shall mean the latest standard specification, manual, code, or laws or regulations in effect at the time of City acceptance. However, no provision of any referenced standard specification, manual, or code shall be effective to change the duties and responsibilities of the City or any of their consultants, agents, or employees from those set forth in these Standards and Specifications. Work shall be done in compliance with the accepted plans and to the satisfaction of the City.

10. Consideration shall be given, within the established framework of local streets, to provide for uniformity of street widths, proper alignment, street names, and conformity to existing street patterns. The street design shall be directly related to the traffic needs. The streets, intersections, driveways, and pedestrian facilities shall be designed to provide for the greatest safety for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists.

11. All alleys, when permitted by the City Engineer, shall be paved to the full width of right-of-way, or as approved by the Chief Engineer, and shall provide paved access to a paved street at both ends.

12. Residential lots adjacent to an arterial street shall be served by a local street. Direct access will not be allowed from any residential lot onto an arterial.

13. Streets of less than the entire minimum right-of-way roadway width should be avoided and permitted only by approval of the Chief Engineer. Sufficient engineering data shall be provided to establish feasibility of widening without causing unacceptable drainage, sight distance, or other issues. Street improvement plans shall include the entire width.

14. Development projects and/or subdivisions adjacent to existing public roadways shall, in addition to dedicating additional right-of-way for future street expansion needs, evaluate existing improvements along those rights-of-way. These improvements include but are not limited to public and private utilities, stormwater facilities, irrigation facilities, fences, etc. Developers shall provide for proper engineering and construction as necessary to modify and/or protect those facilities, as well as provide proper development grading along the existing roadways to accommodate the design and construction of the future roadway improvements. Plans shall include the profiles, cross-sections, and details necessary to fully convey that the design of the future improvements functions with the present design.

15. All proposed projects shall be referenced to the City’s adopted control network and shall obtain the location and elevation of the nearest appropriate reference monument from the Public Works Engineering Division prior to survey. If a suitable City control monument is not located within 2 miles of the proposed project, the City will provide one within 20 working days of the request date. Request can be made to the Public Works department. The monument name and elevation used shall be clearly marked on all construction drawings.

## B. Soils Report and Pavement Design Report
A Geotechnical Report shall be submitted to the City for review and acceptance prior to any construction related to the installation of public improvements or during the development review process. The report shall comply with the requirements outlined in the City of Greeley Geotechnical Design Manual. A checklist can be provided upon request by Public Works to assist in the preparation of the reports. A Pavement Design Report shall also be sent to the City prior to placing any asphalt.

## C. Transportation Impact Studies
Transportation Impact Studies (TIS) are required to adequately assess the impacts of a development proposal on the existing and/or planned street system. Unless waived by the Chief Engineer according to guidelines presented in the "Criteria for Development of Transportation Impact Studies," a TIS report shall be required for all development proposals. A PE registered in the state of Colorado shall prepare the TIS.

## D. Preconstruction Meeting
A preconstruction meeting may be required before any permits for construction are issued. Attendance should include representatives from the Public Works Department, Development Coordinator, Developer/Owner, Design Engineer, General Contractor, and Subcontractors, including earthwork, utilities, curb and gutter, paving, and signing.
