| **Definition**                | Limited use streets that provide property access and serve as primary locations for freight loading and solid waste, recycling, and organics collection. Designed for low speeds (10 mph) and discourage through traffic beyond one block. | Roads that provide limited mobility and primary access to residential areas, businesses, farms, and other local areas.                  | Streets with shared zones for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motor vehicles, often prioritizing pedestrians and low vehicle speeds and volumes.      | Major and minor roads connecting local roads to arterials. Balances mobility and land access at lower speeds and shorter distances.              | Roadways serving major centers of metropolitan areas, providing high mobility and connections to freeways. Land access through driveways allowed. |

### Notes

1. 12' lanes shall only be permitted with truck percentages above 15 percent.
2. Four-lane sections shall only be permitted with approval from the Public Works Director.
3. Traffic calming elements shall be required on all streets. Request the Traffic Calming Workbook from Public Works to demonstrate adequate traffic calming elements have been added to the roadway corridor.
4. Design for bike lanes shall include a separation element from the travel lane.
5. Travel lanes shall be measured from edge to edge of gutter/pavement joint.
6. Designers shall use the following design guides: NACTO, Projects for Public Spaces, Ped Bike Info.
7. Optional elements italicized.
8. Pedestrian-scale lighting to be located between the Amenity Zone and Frontage Zone.
9. Width shall depend on the need for enhanced bicycle facilities per NACTO publication *Designing for Small Things with Wheels* and *All Ages and Abilities* for determining if the roadway requires Protected Bicycle Facilities or merely additional traffic calming along the roadway segment.
10. Capacity numbers reflect an estimated range. Traffic data falling in or out of the stated range does not, on its own, determine the classification.
11. When multiple options are available for street configuration outside the travel lanes, refer to the "Contextual Guidance for Selecting All Ages & Abilities Bikeways" table in the NACTO *Designing for All Ages & Abilities* document. Use the ADT volume in the table to determine the appropriate bicycle facility option.

### Functional Classification Descriptions

Functional classifications describe how each street is meant to function in its functional classification context. Since multiple street classifications can be appropriate for a functional classification, it is important to note what distinguishes each.

The following descriptions identify how each classification should operate to accommodate vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. These descriptions should be used as a tool to select optional corridor elements and not to select a street classification. Doing so will help the designer focus on all modes during design with an appropriate context for each mode.

| **Functional Classification** | **Local**       | **Collector**   | **Minor Arterial** | **Major Arterial** |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Street Classification**     | Alley           | Neighborhood    | Pedestrian          | Collector           |
|                               | Pedestrian      | Collector       | Collector           | Arterial            |

#### Local
Local streets serve local traffic, have low traffic volumes, provide direct access to adjacent property, and carry traffic with an origin or a destination within the immediate neighborhood. The street corridor should focus on parking in a traffic context, shared bike lane safety in a bicycle context, and low-volume pedestrian traffic in a pedestrian context.

- **Alley Streets**: Serve local traffic with low volumes. Designed for speeds at 10 mph or lower. Wide enough to accommodate freight loading, solid waste transit, and organics collection. Discourages through traffic beyond one block. Focuses on City and business maintenance services.
- **Neighborhood Streets**: Serve local traffic with low volumes. Designed for speeds at 20 mph, including parking on both sides. Supports shared use for bicycles and includes 6' detached sidewalks with a 7'-9' parkway buffer. Focuses on resident services.
- **Pedestrian Streets**: Serve local traffic with low volumes. Designed for speeds at 25 mph, including 7' parallel parking lanes. Features 4' amenity zones, 6' frontage zones, and pedestrian-focused lighting. Focuses on serving pedestrians.
- **Collector Streets**: Serve local traffic with low volumes. Designed for speeds at 30 mph or lower, including 7' parallel parking lanes. Supports bicycles with sharrows and pedestrians with a 10' shared-use path and a 7' tree lawn. Includes 12' grass medians to slow traffic and provide pedestrian refuge. Focuses on businesses and customers.

---

#### Collector
Collector streets serve traffic traveling from local street to local street and have moderate traffic volumes. They collect and distribute traffic between arterial and local streets, linking neighborhoods and carrying traffic within the community. The corridor focuses on parking, shared on-street bike lane safety, and moderate pedestrian traffic.

- **Pedestrian Streets**: Serve community traffic with moderate volumes. Designed for speeds at 25 mph or lower, including 7' parallel parking lanes. Supports bicycles with markings, signs, and signals for driver awareness. Features 8' amenity zones, 8' frontage zones, and pedestrian-focused lighting.
- **Collector Streets**: Serve local traffic with moderate volumes. Designed for speeds at 30 mph or lower, including 7' parallel parking lanes. Features 6' bike lanes on both sides, a 10' shared-use path, and a 7' tree lawn. Includes 12' landscape medians for traffic calming and pedestrian refuge. At intersections, 10' turn lanes can replace medians. Focuses on businesses and customers.

---

#### Minor Arterial
Minor arterial streets serve traffic traveling from collector streets and have moderate traffic volumes. They provide relatively unimpeded traffic movement and are suitable for routes with four moving lanes and one turn lane. The corridor focuses on street capacity, dedicated bike lanes, and moderate pedestrian traffic.

- **Collector Streets**: Serve regional traffic with moderate volumes. Designed for speeds at 30 mph or lower, including 7' parallel parking lanes. Features 7' bike lanes on both sides and a 12' two-way left-turn lane for business access. Includes a 10' detached shared-use path with a 10' tree lawn and pedestrian refuge islands. Focuses on businesses and customers.
- **Arterial Streets**: Serve regional traffic with moderate volumes. Designed for speeds at 35 mph or lower, with multiple traffic lanes. Features 6' on-street bike lanes with 2' buffers and a 12' detached shared-use path with a 7' tree lawn. Includes 12' landscape medians for traffic calming and pedestrian refuge. Focuses on regional traffic and transit.

---

#### Major Arterial
Major arterial streets serve traffic traveling from collector or minor arterial streets and have high traffic volumes. They permit rapid and relatively unimpeded traffic movement throughout the city, connecting major land uses and outside communities. The corridor focuses on street capacity, off-street bike facilities, and a four-lane cross-section approved by the Public Works Director.

- **Arterial Streets**: Serve regional traffic with high volumes. Designed for speeds at 35 mph or lower, with multiple traffic lanes. Features 6' bike lanes incorporated into shared-use paths. Includes a 12' detached shared-use path with a 10' tree lawn and 12' landscape medians for traffic calming and pedestrian refuge. Focuses on regional traffic and transit.
